SendPBtoiPhone
==============

Pushover app sends the phone # in your clipboard to your mobile.  Tap the "Click to call" link to immediately call the sent number.

You'll need to register for your own API token, you can do that here: https://pushover.net/apps/build there's an ugly .PNG in the repo for you to use as an app icon on the app registration form.

Then drop in your pushover user key, your API token, and the name of your mobile phone into the Call-iphone.sh file.

As for how to trigger it? 
* Quicksilver
* Services menu
* Or other....
